Significance
The liquid electrolyte plays a 
central role in lithium metal 
batteries, particularly in dictating 
the battery cyclability. Electrolyte 
engineering in recent years has 
become a promising strategy to 
improve cyclability in lithium 
metal batteries. However, owing 
to the complexity of electrolyte 
design, prediction of Coulombic 
efficiency and efficient design of 
electrolytes remains challenging. 
In this work, we adopt a data-
driven approach to build 
machine learning (ML) models for 
electrolyte design. From our 
models, we extract an important 
yet previously unidentified 
insight that low solvent oxygen 
content can lead to superior 
cyclability. Leveraging this insight 
as a strategy, we introduce a 
series of electrolytes with high 
stability and cyclability in lithium 
metal batteries.

Improving Coulombic efficiency (CE) is key to the adoption of high energy density 
lithium metal batteries. Liquid electrolyte engineering has emerged as a promising 
strategy for improving the CE of lithium metal batteries, but its complexity renders 
the performance prediction and design of electrolytes challenging. Here, we develop 
machine learning (ML) models that assist and accelerate the design of high-perfor-
mance electrolytes. Using the elemental composition of electrolytes as the features of 
our models, we apply linear regression, random forest, and bagging models to identify 
the critical features for predicting CE. Our models reveal that a reduction in the solvent 
oxygen content is critical for superior CE. We use the ML models to design electro-
lyte formulations with fluorine-free solvents that achieve a high CE of 99.70%. This 
work highlights the promise of data-driven approaches that can accelerate the design 
of high-performance electrolytes for lithium metal batteries.

Electrification of transportation is crucial for reducing carbon footprint and mitigating 
climate change (1). For wider deployment of electric vehicles, however, rechargeable bat-
teries with energy densities up to 500 Wh kg−1 are in demand (2, 3). The lithium metal 
anode, regarded as the holy grail of anode technology, is essential for achieving 500 Wh 
kg−1 (2). Despite their high energy densities, lithium metal anodes are not widely deployed 
in today’s smartphones and electric vehicles as they suffer from poor cyclability that stems 
from excessive side reactions and the formation of inactive lithium (4, 5). Alongside host 
structures (6–8) and interfacial engineering (9, 10), electrolyte engineering has recently 
emerged as a promising strategy for improving the cycling efficiency of lithium metal 
anodes (11–15). Electrolyte engineering has pushed the Coulombic efficiency (CE), a 
sought-after metric of cycle life defined as the discharge capacity over the charge capacity, 
to 99.5% (13, 16) and enabled more than 200 cycles in an anode-free configuration (14), 
propelling the lithium metal anode closer to practical application.
The promise of electrolyte engineering has garnered increased attention and research efforts 
(11–14, 16–19). The resulting accumulation of data presents an opportunity for a data-driven 
study that can extract previously overlooked insights and provide new electrolyte engineering 
solutions. Machine learning (ML) has previously been deployed for battery research, where 
a major research direction utilizes simulation-derived data to train ML models. Sendek et al. 
and Ahmad et al. built models to identify potential solid electrolyte materials with high 
conductivity and predict lithium deposition, respectively (20, 21), while Nakayama et al. 
developed an ML model to estimate the coordination energy of solvents with Li+ in liquid 
electrolytes based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and physical properties 
(22). These computation-based studies provide an avenue to effectively screen a large number 
of materials and molecules. However, first principles-based modeling at the battery cell level 
is prohibitively expensive (23), and as these studies focus on computed results, many of them 
stop short of providing experimental validation of the model.
Empirical data-driven approaches can be effective complementary strategies (23). There 
are numerous studies that utilize ML for battery diagnostics, such as the estimation of the 
state of charge (SOC) and cycle life (24–27). Severson et al. conducted a series of notable 
investigations in which they developed an ML model that predicts the cycle life of battery 
cells (26) and utilized the model in a closed-loop Bayesian optimization algorithm to 
obtain advanced fast-charging protocols (27). As such, experimental data-driven methods 
can lead to models that effectively predict battery performance and guide the design of 
practical solutions. Most of these models, however, are confined to battery diagnostics for 
a single cell design, and models capable of predicting the performance of various designs 
and probing molecular intricacies are rare.
In this study, we collect a dataset spanning a large design space to develop supervised 
ML models that can assist the prediction and optimization of CE of various electrolytes

for lithium metal anodes (Fig. 1A). Because the electrolyte’s effect 
on CE is highly complex (28) and prohibitively expensive to track 
using simulations (23), a data-driven approach is particularly fit-
ting for this study. We organized a dataset of 150 entries of Li | 
Cu cell CE with various liquid electrolytes from the literature and 
experiments and used the elemental compositions of the liquid 
electrolytes as features of our model. Using the dataset, we train 
and test numerous ML models such as linear regression, support 
vector machine, bagging, and random forest models. We identify 
that solvent oxygen ratio (sO) is the most important feature, where 
lower sO correlates with higher CE. Utilizing the model as a design 
guideline, we introduce novel electrolyte formulations that use 
fluorine-free solvents that achieve CEs up to 99.70%. We envision 
that this work can initiate data-driven approaches to battery elec-
trolyte engineering.
Results and Discussion
Data Acquisition and Processing. The availability of data is a key 
enabler of a data-driven study (23). Considerable attention to 
electrolyte engineering research has led to a build-up of data on 
different electrolytes in the literature (11–13, 16, 17), enabling the 
data collection for our study. We collected 150 data points of Li | 
Cu cell CE, ranging from 80% to 99.5%, of different electrolytes 
for our dataset—the complete dataset and the references are 
available in the supporting files. We used Li|Cu data for our study 
because such cell configurations have larger dataset representation 
in the literature, are easy to reproduce across groups, and enable 
assessments of Li-electrolyte stability without the confounding 
effects of cathodes. The set of electrolytes includes conventional, 
high concentration, localized high concentration, fluorinated, 
dual salt, and additive-enhanced electrolytes, featuring 54 
solvents and 17 salts (Fig. 1B  and  SI Appendix, Table S1 and 
Figs. S1–14). As different experimental conditions can affect the 
measured CE values (29), our Li | Cu cell data were restricted to 
a narrow current range of 0.4 to 1 mA cm–2 and a capacity range 
of 0.5 to 1 mAh cm–2.
Elemental compositions were selected to be the input features of 
our model (Table 1 and Fig. 1C). The elemental composition of the 
electrolyte encompasses information on important properties such 
as solvation and SEI composition. For example, it has been seen that 
fluorine decoration on solvents can lead to weaker solvation (13, 30, 
31), and high-concentration electrolytes that contain large amounts 
of Li salts—typically composed of inorganic elements—have ani-
on-rich solvation structures (11, 32). Furthermore, because the SEI 
is formed from the decomposition of the electrolyte, the SEI

composition is intimately related to the electrolyte composition 
(13, 17). We provide detailed information by specifying the location 
of the elements and also add elemental ratios as features (Table 1). 
It is noteworthy that even though elemental composition is beneficial 
for our ML approach, it does not completely capture molecular 
nuances like the geometric arrangement of elements in isomers. 
Nuances of this type have been shown to affect electrolyte properties 
and battery performance (33, 34), so future studies should encode 
such molecular details to improve ML robustness.
Although CE is a commonly used metric, it is not necessarily the 
most relevant and effective metric as a target variable for a ML study. 
CE has an upper bound of 100%, where many data points are con-
centrated (SI Appendix, Figs. S2–S14). As we approach this limit, 
significant differences in electrolyte properties will translate to infin-
itesimally small CE changes. Owing to these reasons, we transformed 
CE into a more relevant metric named logarithmic Coulombic effi-
ciency (LCE), defined as LCE = –log10(1 – CE) (Fig. 1C). The trans-
formation yields data more suitable for training an ML model 
(SI Appendix, Figs. S2–S14). The LCE metric is highly interpretable 
as it systematically reflects an increase in CE; for example, an LCE 
of 1 translates to a 90% CE, an LCE of 2 represents a 99% CE, and 
an LCE of 3 represents a 99.9% CE (Fig. 1C).
Model Development. Like many reports of ML applied to physical 
sciences (26, 35), our dataset is relatively small, due to the paucity 
of unique electrolyte mixtures reported in the literature. Owing to 
the small dataset size and a significant number of input features 
used in this study, we employ forward stepwise selection (36, 37) 
to reduce the number of features required for the model. By 
starting with a model that contains no feature, forward stepwise 
selection sequentially selects the regression feature that minimizes 
the residual sum of squares (RSS) the most during each inclusion 
of a new feature. The dimensionality of this forward stepwise 
selection is constrained to eight features to avoid overfitting on 
our training data, indicating that we are selecting the best eight 
features from the 13 features in our dataset. As shown in Fig. 2A, 
the forward stepwise selection algorithm evolves from a model 
that contains only solvent oxygen (sO), to a model that includes 
seven other features. The sole inclusion of sO when the model

is reduced to one feature suggests that sO is the most important 
feature for explaining the variance in LCE. As the number of 
features increases, aC, InOr, and FO are sequentially included in 
the model, showing that they are also important for explaining 
the variance in LCE.
As the number of features increases, the RSS reduces, consistent 
with our expectations (SI Appendix, Fig. S15) (36, 38). However, 
this apparent improvement in model robustness can be misleading 
because an increase in the number of features makes models more 
prone to overfitting. As such, we apply fourfold cross-validation 
(CV) to identify the number of features that appropriately bal-
ances the degree of bias and the extent of variance in our models, 
as other studies have shown (35, 39). Our CV result shows that 
the four-feature model has the lowest mean CV error (Fig. 2B), 
which suggests that the model is less susceptible to variation when 
tested with unseen data. The stability of the four-feature model 
against unseen data is also verified using multiple partitions of the 
training dataset (SI Appendix, Fig. S16). T o further show the 
robustness of the four-feature model, we calculated the Bayesian 
information criterion (BIC) for each of the models selected in 
Fig. 2A. The BIC estimate penalizes models with a high number 
of features because their prediction errors on training sets are 
usually underestimates of the test error (40). From Fig. 2C, the 
BIC estimate for the four-feature model is also one of the lowest, 
further suggesting that the four-feature model is robust and useful 
for test predictions. Using linear regression, we also show compa-
rable test and training mean-squared error (MSE) estimates of 
0.34 and 0.23, respectively, for the four-feature model.
We also benchmark our four-feature linear model to other ML 
models like bagging, random forest, and boosting, showing com-
parable test performance across the models (Table 2). This shows 
that the four-feature linear model is robust for predicting LCE. Also, 
by plotting predicted efficiency against observed efficiency, we 
observe that most of the test data points for the linear, random 
forest, and boosting models lie close to the line of perfect prediction 
and are distributed similarly to the training data points (Fig. 2 D–F). 
This suggests that the selected four features are stable for predicting 
LCE against unseen data. Even though the random forest, bagging, 
and boosting models provide robust predictions, similar to what 
other studies have shown (41, 42), we restrict the majority of our 
model analysis in subsequent segments of the paper to the four-fea-
ture linear model because of its high interpretability.
Model Verification and Analysis. T o further verify the robustness 
of our ML models, we prepared a list of candidate electrolytes un-
seen by the model that represent a large portion of the electrolyte 
design space to be tested against our model. The list was created by 
a combination of the following components: three carbonate sol-
vents—ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), and 
fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC); three ether solvents—dimethox-
yethane (DME), 1,3-dioxolane (DOL), and tetraethylene glycol 
dimethyl ether (TEGDME); three salts—lithium bis(fluorosul-
fonyl)imide (LiFSI), lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF 6), and 
lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI); four salt 
concentrations—1 to 4 M; two additives—vinylene carbonate 
(VC) and lithium nitrate; and the use of a fluorinated diluent, 
1,1,2,2‐tetrafluoroethyl‐2,2,3,3‐tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE). 
The list includes carbonate-based electrolytes, ether-based electro-
lytes, high-concentration electrolytes (HCE), localized high-con-
centration electrolytes (LHCE), and additive-enhanced electro-
lytes (SI Appendix, Table S2). Among the 34 candidate electrolytes, 
we selected 13 electrolytes across the different types of electrolytes 
to test our model. Fig. 3A shows the predicted efficiencies plotted 
against measured efficiencies, where the formula for each num-
bered electrolyte can be found in SI Appendix, Table S2. We ob-
serve a close match between measured and predicted efficiencies 
and a rms error of 0.17. This further validates that our model 
works reliably well across many commonly used electrolytes.
One of the advantages of a linear model is its interpretability 
(43). Our model has the form
LCE =− 4.481sO + 0.052FO + 0.188InOr

consisting of four features—sO, fluorine to oxygen ratio (FO), 
inorganic to organic elemental ratio (InOr), and anion carbon 
ratio (aC). sO and aC have negative coefficients, indicating that 
decreasing solvent oxygen content and anion carbon content leads 
to superior CE. On the other hand, FO and InOr have positive 
coefficients, signifying that greater inorganic content (defined here 
as elements excluding carbon and hydrogen) and fluorine content 
over oxygen content are favorable for higher CE. T o further eval-
uate the relative importance of the four features, we used the 
random forest model, averaged over 500 decision trees, to analyze 
the importance of the four features based on percentage MSE 
increase and node purity (Fig. 3 B and C). Our results show that 
the order of importance of these features is aC, InOr, FO, then 
sO, with sO being the most important feature. It is noteworthy 
that these features are not collinear, as evidenced by their low 
variance inflation factors (SI Appendix, Fig. S17).
The most notable yet previously unidentified insight extracted 
from this analysis is that sO is the most important determinant 
of CE (Fig. 3 B and C). An example that illustrates this point is 
the comparison between carbonates and ether electrolytes; ethers 
contain fewer oxygen atoms than carbonates and are known to be 
more stable with Li metal (SI Appendix, Fig. S18) (28, 44). 
Another example is the comparison between DME and diethox-
yethane (DEE); DEE, which has a lower sO than DME, has a 
significantly improved CE (SI Appendix, Fig. S18) (19). This sug-
gests that reducing sO may be a promising strategy for improving 
CE, which we deploy in the following section to design novel 
high-performance electrolytes. FO comes second in importance; 
increasing fluorine content while decreasing oxygen content has 
been shown to correlate with high performance (13, 16, 17, 45). 
InOr is another significant factor to LCE, where higher inorganic 
content in the SEI has often been correlated to improved CE 
(16, 30, 46). Lastly, aC shows a negative impact on CE, which 
can be exemplified by the comparison between LiFSI and LiTFSI.
The importance of solvent oxygen content over fluorine content 
is unexpected, as fluorine has been the recent focus of electrolyte 
design for lithium metal batteries (13, 31, 44, 45, 47, 48). It is 
thought to be a critical element in electrolytes (44) that leads to 
the formation of LiF in the SEI, which has been correlated with 
superior cycling performance (17, 49). In addition, fluorinated 
solvents have been instrumental in the success of many high-per-
formance electrolytes (12, 13, 16, 28). Indeed, fluorine appears 
in the FO term and is a major contributor to the InOr term, both 
of which indicate that fluorine may play an important role. 
However, our model analysis reveals that sO is the strongest pre-
dictor of CE, and scatterplots show that high CEs above 99% can 
be attained at 0 solvent fluorine content (SI Appendix, Fig. S9), 
highlighting the role of solvent oxygen which had previously 
received little attention. A plausible hypothesis is that the effects 
of fluorine on solvation and the SEI may be attainable by tuning 
solvent oxygen content. Fluorine decoration of solvents is known 
to weaken the solvation of Li + (13, 30), and similar effects may 
be attainable through reducing the solvent oxygen content. In 
localized high-concentration electrolytes, the fluorinated co-sol-
vents play a role of diluting the solution while being inactive in 
solvation and could potentially be substituted with a non-solvating 
non-fluorinated co-solvent. In the following discussion, we explore 
the effectiveness of tuning solvent oxygen content as a strategy to 
achieve high CEs.
Model-guided Electrolyte Design.  Our model analysis revealed 
that solvent oxygen content is the most important feature in 
our model, and reducing sO may be a strategy to improve CE. 
We deployed this strategy to design novel high-performance 
electrolytes. Fig. 4A shows the sO of several ether solvents. We 
sought to find ether solvents that have lower sO values than DME 
and identified methyl butyl ether (MBE), methyl t-butyl ether 
(MTBE), and dibutyl ether (DBE) with sO values of 0.056, 0.056, 
and 0.037, respectively. Using these solvents mixed with non-
solvating diluents (50), we designed four electrolytes that our 
model predicted to have high performance. As shown in Fig. 4B, 
these electrolytes show average CEs as high as 99.70%. Electrolytes 
using MTBE and DBE mixed with toluene are particularly 
notable, not only for the high CE of 99.64% and 99.70%, but 
also for their potential for mass production; MTBE and DBE 
are common solvents used in the petroleum industry (51, 52), 
and toluene is an important aromatic hydrocarbon solvent (53). 
The fluorine-free solvents of this electrolyte are interesting from a 
fundamental aspect as well, as most high-performance electrolytes 
use highly fluorinated solvents and co-solvents (12, 13, 16, 17, 
54–56) that can alter solvation and the SEI. Fluorinated co-
solvents are key to the solvation structure and high performance 
of localized high-concentration electrolytes (LHCE) (12, 16, 55). 
In addition, lithium fluoride (LiF) in the SEI that arises from the 
decomposition of fluorinated species is believed to play a major role 
in stabilizing the lithium metal cyclability (17, 54, 56). Therefore, 
understanding the working mechanism of these electrolytes is key 
to understanding the ML model.
T o characterize the solvation properties of these electrolytes, we 
compared the solvation free energy of Li+ of 1 M LiFSI MTBE-
toluene against a reference electrolyte of 1 M LiFSI DME using 
a technique recently developed in our group (Fig. 4C). This tech-
nique probes the relative solvation energy of an electrolyte by 
measuring the potential of an electrochemical cell that contains 
symmetric electrodes and asymmetric electrolytes (30). Our meas-
urement shows that 1 M LiFSI MTBE-toluene has much weaker 
solvation, revealing a difference of 403 meV or 38.9 kJ mol −1. 
Solvation is intricately related to the SEI, which we characterized 
using cryogenic electron microscopy. The HR-TEM images, 
shown in Fig. 4 D and E and SI Appendix, Figs. S19 and S20, 
reveal that 1 M LiFSI MTBE-toluene shows a thin SEI of ~7 nm, 
approximately 2 nm thinner than 1 M LiFSI DME. In addition, 
the stronger contrast of the SEI of 1 M LiFSI MTBE-toluene 
suggests denser and more inorganic nature of the SEI. Energy-
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) illustrates that 1 M LiFSI 
MTBE-toluene has a more oxygen-rich SEI (Fig. 4F and 
SI Appendix, Fig. S21). This is particularly interesting as the sol-
vent with less oxygen leads to a more oxygen-rich SEI. We infer 
that this effect is due to suppressed solvent decomposition that 
likely resulted from the decrease in sO, which leads to a more 
anion-derived SEI, a phenomenon seen in other high-performance 
electrolytes (12, 13, 16). Fig. 4 G and H and SI Appendix, 
Figs. S22 and S23 show the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 
images of the 0.5 mAh cm−2 of lithium deposited on copper foil. 
Insets at high magnification show that the 1 M LiFSI MTBE-
toluene has larger lithium deposits with smaller surface area in 
comparison with 1 M LiFSI DME. A particularly interesting 
observation is that, whereas 1 M LiFSI DME shows full Li cov-
erage, 1 M LiFSI MTBE-toluene has islands of lithium deposits. 
This further demonstrates the smaller surface area of the lithium 
deposits formed in our electrolyte and also hints that during the 
course of deposition, growth of existing Li nuclei may be favored 
over nucleation of Li.
We also verify the electrolytes' oxidative stability and the com-
patibility with commercial cathodes (SI Appendix, Figs. S24–S26). 
The oxidative stability of our MTBE-toluene electrolyte likely 
originates from an increase in reduction and oxidation voltage

Overall, we see that the electrolyte with a superior CE has weaker 
solvation and a more anion-derived SEI as well as larger Li depos-
its, which is consistent with our previous proposition (30). We 
also demonstrate that tuning the solvent oxygen content can 
achieve high CE for lithium metal anodes, adding support to the 
hypothesis that the effect of fluorinated solvents in weakening 
solvation could be emulated by decreasing sO. Taken together, 
our results indicate that low sO improves CE by reducing the 
likelihood of solvent decomposition, increasing the formation of 
favorable anion-rich SEI species, and reducing the contact area of 
Li deposits.
Our model unveils important insights that can accelerate the 
design of high-performance electrolytes. Nevertheless, there are 
ample opportunities for improvements to our model and future 
developments of complex models with greater accuracy and 
wider applicability. Our model is trained on a dataset comprised 
of literature data, which is concentrated toward electrolytes that 
work reasonably well. Due to the nature of our dataset, insights 
regarding unexplored classes of electrolytes may be limited. 
Feeding additional data or interweaving computational methods 
with our model can be effective approaches to add to the gen-
eralizability of the model. Also, greater sensitivity to additives 
such as FEC and lithium nitrate that are used in small quantities 
could be improved by distinguishing additives from solvents and 
salts. Furthermore, capturing the molecular structural informa-
tion could be possible by using simplified molecular-input 
line-entry system (SMILES) (59). We envision that our model 
can serve as a first-generation model that can be modified and 
improved for a more powerful model with improved predictive 
capabilities.

Conclusions
This report introduces a data-driven approach to electrolyte opti-
mization. We built ML models upon Li | Cu CE data from liter-
ature and experiments, and we found that among the different 
features that affect CE, solvent oxygen content stands out as the 
most decisive factor. Leveraging the insight as a design strategy, 
we introduced a series of electrolytes using fluorine-free solvents 
that can achieve high CEs up to 99.70%. Our model and electro-
lytes suggest that careful control of solvent oxygen content can 
lead to weak solvation and inorganic SEI that form the basis for 
high Li metal compatibility. We believe that this work highlights 
the promise of data-driven approaches in building models and 
identifying overlooked insights, and we hope that our work can 
provide some directions to reaching CEs of 99.9% and beyond.
Methods
Data Acquisition and Processing. Data containing Coulombic efficiencies of 
Cu | Li cells with current and capacity close to 0.5 mA cm–2 and 1.0 mAh cm–2 were 
collected from the literature. Using the electrolyte formula, the elemental compo-
sition data of each electrolyte were extracted. Number of moles per liter of solvent 
was calculated by using the molar mass and density. Using the chemical formula 
of the solvents, the elemental composition of the solvents could be calculated. 
Density of solvent mixtures was assumed to be weighted averages of the compo-
nents, and the salt content was approximated to have negligible effect on the total 
volume of the solution. The anion elemental composition could also be calculated 
by using the molar concentration and the salt chemical formula. Elemental com-
position could be calculated by taking the ratio between the number of atoms of 
the element over the total number of atoms in a liter of solution. For example, 
carbon solvent ratio could be calculated by taking the ratio between the number 
of carbon atoms in the solvent with the total number of atoms in the electrolyte. 
Additives were included as either salt or solvent, depending on their chemical 
forms. An example of the feature data extraction process is shown in Supporting 
Note. Inorganic content refers to all elements except carbon and hydrogen and 
lithium. Organic content refers to only carbon. InOr is a ratio between inorganic 
content and organic content. Hydrogen and lithium were excluded from the 
two categories, because they are well known to be present in both organic and 
inorganic materials. CE of the acquired data is converted into LCE through the 
equation LCE = −log (1 – CE).
ML Model Development. This work involved model fitting (estimating the coef-
ficient values) and model selection (establishing the model structure). To perform 
both simultaneously, subset selection was used.
A linear model of the form:
/uni0302.s1yi = /uni0302.s1w T xi,
was initially proposed, where /uni0302.s1y i represents the predicted LCE of a given electrolyte i, 
x i represents a p-dimensional feature vector for a given electrolyte, and /uni0302.s1w T represents 
the p-dimensional coefficient vector. To perform subset selection, all possible com-
binations of all features for each number of desired features (1–7) were examined 
against the training data, and the best feature combinations were selected using 
residual sum of squares (RSS) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC).
The formula for RSS is
RSS =
n/uni2211.s1
i=1
(yi − /uni0302.s1yi)2 ,
where y i is the n-dimensional vector for all experimentally observed LCEs and n 
represents the number of observations.
The formula for BIC is
BIC = 1
n/uni0302.s1/u1D70E2 (RSS + log(n)d/uni0302.s1/u1D70E2 ),
where /uni0302.s1/u1D70E2 is an estimate of the variance of error associated with each LCE meas-
urement and d is the number of features.
The selected subsets were subsequently tested against the training data using 
fourfold cross-validation. The best performing models were selected based on CV 
error estimates (CV(K) ) which were calculated thus:
CV(K) =
K/uni2211.s1
k =1
nk
n MSEk ,
where K is the number of folds in which the data were divided for CV, nk is the 
number of observations in each of the K folds, and MSEk is the MSE for the obser-
vations in each of the K folds, with the MSE calculated thus:
MSE = 1
n
n/uni2211.s1
i=1
(yi−/uni0302.s1yi)2 .
Subsequently, the robustness of the selected features was measured against 
test data, using rms error (RMSE). RMSE is defined as:
RMSE =
/uni221A.s2
1
n
/uni2211.s1n
i=1 (yi−/uni0302.s1yi)2 .
In summary, we divided our literature data into training and test datasets. We 
selected the best feature combinations and models using subset selection, then 
we applied the models to the test datasets. In addition, we generated a new test 
dataset that contains untested electrolytes, then tested our models against the 
new data. All the data processing and prediction were performed in R using the 
MASS, ISLR, leaps, tree, gbm, and Random Forest libraries.
CE Measurement. All electrolytes were prepared and handled in an argon-filled 
glovebox with a O2 concentration <0.2 ppm and H2O concentration <0.01 ppm. 
All electrolyte materials were used as received. LiFSI (Fluolyte) and LiPF6 (Sigma-
Aldrich) were used as salts and EC (Sigma-Aldrich), FEC (BASF), DMC (Sigma-
Aldrich), DME (Sigma-Aldrich), TEGDME (Sigma-Aldrich), DOL (Sigma-Aldrich), 
MTBE (Sigma-Aldrich), THF (Sigma-Aldrich), TTE (SynQuest), and toluene (Sigma-
Aldrich) were used as solvents. In an argon-filled glovebox, Li | Cu batteries were 
assembled into type 2032 coin cells. Each coin cell used 1 cm2 (750 µm thick) Li 
foil (Alfa Aesar), Cu foil, a separator (Celgard 2325), and 40 μL of electrolyte. Land 
Instruments battery tester was used to cycle the coin cells. For each cell, initially 5 
mA h cm–2 of Li metal was deposited on Cu and stripped (formation cycle). Then 
5 mA h cm–2 of Li metal was deposited again, to act as a Li reservoir. Then Li was 
repeatedly stripped and plated 1 mA h cm–2 for nine cycles. The remaining Li on Cu 
was then stripped, and the average CE was calculated by dividing the total strip-
ping capacity by the total plating capacity after the formation cycle. For all steps, 
the current density was 0.5 mA cm–2. Three cells were tested for each electrolyte.
Cryo-EM Characterization.  For cryogenic electron microscopy characteriza-
tion, lithium was electrodeposited directly onto copper TEM grids by using the 
grids as electrodes inside type 2032 coin cells. After Li metal was deposited, the 
cells were disassembled in an argon-filled glovebox and rinsed to remove salts 
while minimizing artifacts. The sample was then sealed in a container and taken 
out of the glovebox. While the container was submerged in a bath of liquid 
nitrogen (LN2), it was crushed to release the sample to the cryogen without any 
exposure to the atmosphere. Maintaining the sample in LN2, it was loaded onto 
the cryo-EM holder (Gatan 626). The cryo-EM holder is specially designed to 
prevent air exposure of the sample, which preserves the specimen in its native 
state. The holder was inserted into the TEM column. Throughout the character -
ization process, the sample temperature was maintained at around –178 °C.
The cryo-EM characterizations were conducted using a FEI Titan 80–300 envi -
ronmental (scanning) TEM. The instrument was operated at an accelerating volt -
age of 300 kV and was equipped with an aberration corrector, which was tuned 
before each sample analysis. For all characterizations including HR-TEM and 
EDS, electron dose rate was carefully controlled to prevent potential damage to 
the samples. HR-TEM imaging was performed on a Gatan K3 IS direct electron 
detector camera in low dose mode, with an electron dose of 150 to 300 e − Å−2.
Electrolyte and Electrode Characterization. Solvation energy measurements 
were done by using a method developed previously in our group, using an H 
cell with Li metal as electrodes and asymmetric electrolytes. The electrolyte of 
interest was placed in a half-cell, while a reference electrolyte of 1 M LiFSI DEC was

placed in the other. An open circuit potential was measured to probe the relative 
solvation energy. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was conducted using an FEI 
Magellan 400 XHR. 0.5 mAh cm−2 of Li was deposited onto Cu current collectors. 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) signals were collected on a PHI VersaProbe 
1 scanning XPS microprobe with an Al Kα source.
